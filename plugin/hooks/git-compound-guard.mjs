// PreToolUse[Bash] guard — a branch switch is never chained with mutations.
//
// Ported from vfkb's own dogfooded copy (vfkb ADR-0070 §5), generalized for
// any plugin consumer. Observed twice in vfkb's own repo on 2026-07-26:
// `git checkout <branch> && <work>` where the checkout FAILED and the tail
// ran anyway on the wrong branch — once committing work-in-progress under a
// wrong message. The shell's `&&` guards exit codes, not intent: a failed
// switch leaves you somewhere, and the tail neither knows nor cares where.
//
// Blocks: a Bash command in which `git [-C <dir>] checkout|switch` sits at a
// COMMAND POSITION and is followed by a separator (&& ; || or a NEWLINE — in
// bash a newline separates commands exactly like `;`) with more to run.
// File restores (`checkout -- <path>` / `checkout <ref> -- <path>`) are
// exempt.
//
// The command-position anchor exists because this hook's first live firing
// (in vfkb) was a false positive: \b matched `git` inside a heredoc's prose
// documenting this very rule, and then blocked its own fix. Accepted
// residuals, both directions, stated rather than implied: a heredoc LINE
// that itself begins with `git checkout … ;` still trips (rare; costs a
// re-run), and these pass unblocked — `env`/`time`/VAR=1-prefixed switches,
// quoted ones (`sh -c "…"`), `--git-dir=`/`--no-pager`-style long flags, and
// `-C "path with a space"` (the flag skip matches `-C <bareword>` only). A
// shell parser, not a regex, would be needed for those; the hook is a
// guardrail, not a jail.
//
// FAIL-OPEN ON A DEADLINE: a hook must never wedge a tool call. Reading
// stdin only until 'end' measurably never exits when the harness holds
// stdin open (the sibling durable-claim-check hook documents the same
// measurement) — so: settle on a 2s watchdog, DECIDE ON WHATEVER ARRIVED (a
// dangerous payload that arrived before the deadline is still denied — a
// watchdog that discarded the buffer would make the guard silently inert),
// and release stdin so the process can actually exit.
